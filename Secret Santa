Secret Santa
Send Feedback
After spending a lot on money on raw materials, Aakash had no money left for gifts. He wanted to give presents to his employees for the Christmas. He wanted to become "Secret Santa" for them. Luckily, he found P socks for left ankle and Q socks for the right ankle.
Aakash wants to create as many pairs of socks as possible. Each pair must consist of one left sock and one right sock. While pairing the socks, Aakash has to make sure that their ugliness is minimized. The ugliness of a pairing is defined as maximum absolute difference of sock sizes, between all pairs of socks. Can you help Aakash minimize the ugliness of pairs?
Input Format:
The first line of input contains two space separated integers. The integer denotes the value of P and second one denotes the value of Q. The value of P and Q lies in the range: [1, 100000].
The following line contains P space separated integers, that denote the sizes of socks available for left ankle. 
The following line contains Q space separated integers, that denote the sizes of socks available for right ankle.
The sizes of socks lie in the range: [1, 1e9].
Note: 1e9 is a scientific notation, which means 1 followed by nine zeroes.
Constraints:
Time Limit: 1 second
Output Format:
The first and only line of output contains minimum ugliness between all pairings. 
Sample Input 1:
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
2 3 4 5
Sample Output 1:
0
Explanation:
The pairings will 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 5-5. The maximum absolute difference between all pairs is 0
