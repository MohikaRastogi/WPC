Robert and his kingdom
Send Feedback
It has been a prosperous year for King Robert and he is rapidly expanding his empire. This kingdom has many cities connected by two-way roads(bidirectional). To ensure higher connectivity, two cities are sometimes directly linked by more than one road.
King Robert wants a better connectivity between these two cities of his kingdom. To do so, he wants to determine the sum of the minimum distances between each pair of cities and represnt it in binary representation.
His kindom has N cities and M bidirectional roads. Each of the roads has a distinct length, and each length is a power of two (i.e., 2 raised to some exponent). It's possible to reach any city from any other city.
Input Format:
->The first line contains two space-seperated integers denoting N (the number of cities) and M (the number of roads), respectively. 
->Each line i of the M subsequent lines contains the respective values of Ai, Bi, and Ci as three space-separated integers. These values define a bidirectional road between cities Ai and Bi having length 2^Ci.
Constraints
1<=N<=100000
1<=M<=200000
1<=Ai,Bi<=N, (Ai != Bi)
0<=Ci<M
All Ci are distinct
Output Format:
Find the sum of minimum distances of each pair of cities and print the answer in binary representation.
Sample Input:
6
1 3 5
4 5 0
2 1 3
3 2 1
4 3 4
4 2 2
Sample Output:
1000100
Explanation:
let d(x,y) be the minimum distance between city x and city y.
d(1,2)=8
d(1,3)=10
d(1,4)=12
d(1,5)=13
d(2,3)=2
d(2,4)=4
d(2,5)=5
d(3,4)=6
d(3,5)=7
d(4,5)=1
Sum = 8+10+12+13+2+4+5+6+7+1 = 65 = 1000100(in binary)
