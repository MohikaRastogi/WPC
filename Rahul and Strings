Rahul and Strings
Send Feedback
Rahul likes equality. One day his professor gave him two Strings, A and B, he want to make them equal. But Rahul is little busy in studying, so he want your help in determining if it's possible to make A equal to B using the following operations. If so, print 1 on a new line. Otherwise, print 0.
You can perform the following operations on the string, :
1) You can convert zero or more of A's lowercase letters to uppercase.
2) You can remove all of the remaining lowercase letters in string A.
For example, given A=AbcDE and B=ABDE, in A we can convert b and delete c to match B. If A=AbcDE and b=AD, matching is not possible because capital letters can not be deleted.
Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer q, the number of queries.
Each of the next q pairs of lines is as follows: 
- The first line of each query contains a single string, A. 
- The second line of each query contains a single string, B.
Constraints
1<=q<=10
1<|a|,|b|<=1000
String A consists only of uppercase and lowercase English letters, ascii[A-Z,a-z].
String B consists only of uppercase English letters, ascii[A-Z].
Output Format:
For each query, print 1 on a new line if it's possible to make string A equal to string B. Otherwise, print 0.
Sample Input:
1
sdEGgGb
SEGGB
Sample Output:
1
Explanation:
We have A=sdEGgGb and  B=SEGGB. We perform the following operation:

1)Capitalize the letters s and b in A so that  A=SdEGgGB.
2)Delete all the remaining lowercase letters in A so that A=SEGGB.
Because we were able to successfully convert A to B, we print 1 on a new line.
