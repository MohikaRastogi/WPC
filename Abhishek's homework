Send Feedback
Abhishek couldn't even finish half of the homework exercises in "Advanced topics in maths" class. The teacher is really upset and gives him one final problem to solve - if he can't solve it, he is gonna fail the course.
Abhishek is a given a number N, he need to find no. of distinct perfect squares or perfect cubes from 1 to N ( both inclusive ).
Abhishek wanted to ask the teacher about the definition of perfert square and perfect cube but he remembered that he had heard this term in last week's lesson just before falling asleep. Now his life is in your hands again!
Note : If a number, like 729, which is both square ( 27^2 ) and cube (9^3) should be counted once only.
