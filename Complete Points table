Complete Points table
Send Feedback
Vikas was binge watching highlights of league matches of famous Indian Premier League. He came across points table. The points table had following five columns or five statistics for each team: total number of games played, how many those games the team won, drew and lost and total points earned. A team earns 3 points when it wins the match, a team earns 1 point when it draws the match.
Vikas noticed that values of some fields can be calculated from the others.
So, he has come up with a table whose some fields are unfilled. You have to complete the points table.
Note: The data of different team is not related. For example, the data of the table may say that all the teams have won all the games (although, this is not possible in real league's points table). It is also given that each team can play at most 100 games.
Input Format:
The first line contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000), the number of teams in the league.
Each of the following N lines contains the 5 fields for one team separated by single spaces, containing the 5 pieces of data as described in the problem statement. Each field contains an integer (at least 0), or the character '?' (question mark) if the value is not known.
The input will be consistent and there will be a unique way to determine the values of the missing fields. 
Constraints:
Time Limit: 1 second
Output Format:
Output the table with the missing fields filled in.
