Jessa and her array
Send Feedback
Walter is out of town, and Jessa is alone at the office. She was bored, so she took a piece of paper and wrote down a sequence A of length N, which contains each positive integer between 1 and N, inclusive, exactly once. After that, she took another piece of paper and wrote down M descriptions of the sequence A.
Each description has one of the following formats:
If the maximum number in positions between x and y (inclusive) equals v, then it would be written in following format:1 x y v
If the smallest or minimum number in positions between x and y (inclusive) equals v, then it would be written in following format: 2 x y v.
Then Walter came, saw, and stole the first paper. Jessa is desperate and has asked you to find some sequence matching the descriptions, not necessarily equal to the original sequence.
Note:If multiple solution exist, you can print any.
Input Format:
The first line of input contains two positive integers N, the length of the sequence, and M, the number of descriptions. 
Each of the following M lines contains a description as described above.
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 200
0 ≤ M ≤ 40000
Output Format:
The first and only line of output must contain a sequence of N space-separated positive integers (matching the descriptions and containing all positive integers from 1 to N), or -1 if no such sequence exists. 
Sample Input1:
3 2
1 1 1 1
2 2 2 2
Sample Output1:
1 2 3
Sample Input2:
4 2
1 1 1 1
2 3 4 1
Sample Output2:
-1
